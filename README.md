## Background

In this project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline to process crowdfunding data from Excel files. We extracted and transformed the data, created four CSV files, and then used the CSV files to create a database in Jupyter notebook and a table schema.

## Features

- Extract and transform crowdfunding and contact data from Excel files
- Create and export Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contact DataFrames as CSV files
- Design a table schema for the database
- Create and populate database tables

## Data Sources

Within resources folder:
Category.csv
Subcategory.csv
(Campaign.csv)[Resources/campaign.csv]
Contacts.csv

## Built With

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel

# Project Outline

The instructions for this project were separated into four subsections: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames, Create the Campaign DataFrames, Create the Contacts DataFrame, and Create the Crowdfunding Database. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python packages: 
`pandas`
`jupyter notebook`

## Instructions

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to extract and transform data, and create CSV files.
2. Use the provided `ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb` file to create tables in the Python database.
3. Load the CSV files into the corresponding Python tables.
4. Query the database to verify the data has been loaded correctly.
